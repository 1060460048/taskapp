#Task App
## Simple task manager application built using AngularJS /Laravel PHP / MySQL
### Based on tutorial by angular code @ http://www.angularcode.com/simple-task-manager-application-using-angularjs-php-mysql/

This small app builds on original tutorial by Angular Code on how to create a simple Task Manager application using AngularJS. I have used Laravel for routes and for talking to the database.
You will need to edit app/config/app.php to setup your database connection.
